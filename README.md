# PoliChain Hackathon Project - Betting Site

![alt text](./bob.jpg)

## Welcome to our group's project for the PoliChain hackathon! 

This is a web application developed using Vite, React, JSX, and connected to Metamask to create a decentralized betting site. Our application allows two participants to place a bet, and a judge determines the winner. The winner is rewarded with cryptocurrency, all managed by a smart contract on the blockchain.

The deployed version of the website runs on Sepolia Chain and is available on https://frontend-betting.vercel.app/
